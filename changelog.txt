== Changelog ==

_(Historical only)_

= 0.2.5 =
* Fixed a security issue: non-admin users could see the LSL script

= 0.2.4 =
* Fixed missing <?php (was just <? )
* Added some extra validation code for usernames. When the SL name -> WP username conversion fails, it aborts
* Changed the way that the hostname is figured out for the LSL script
* Started some development to allow users to add their email addresses from within SL
* Updated FAQ!
* moved banner and screenshots to assets; trunk is now empty and "stable tags" is used instead

= 0.2.3 =
* Added llStringTrim() to the LSL script after receiving a remote message. Thanks to ANSI Soderstrom for spotting that this sometimes failed due to extra space on some web servers.

= 0.2.2 =
* **functions.php** was missing from the distribution! Thanks to ANSI Soderstrom for pointing it out to me.

= 0.2.1 =
* Add option to ignore signature (less safer, but good for debugging/testing purposes)

= 0.2.0 =

* Security configuration module implemented: limit avatars to register objects with our site; ban avatars from registering with our site; limit hostnames/IP addresses

= 0.1.6 =

* Fixed minor script issues to work with OpenSimulator 0.7.0.2+

= 0.1.5 =

* Users already registered, when touching the object again, will now get a popup allowing them to reset the password instead of silently failing to register them again
* Now new users will have an email address with the site's domain name appended. This might be useful for some services that will provide SL residents with mailboxes
* Updated registration object timestamp every time a new avatar registers or changes their password

= 0.1.0 =

* Added required screenshots for WP
* Retrieves avatar profile information from world.secondlife.com/resident/<AVATAR UUID> and puts it into WP profile
* Simplified admin page: now when deleting an object, it also sends a llDie() to it
* Added instructions tab
* Translations for Portuguese included

= 0.0.5 =
* Avatars get registered with fake email address, because logins wouldn't work if they hadn't one
* Registration IM now shows URL of the website they've registered to
* Added two additional strings to allow for minimal security; they still cannot be saved thanks to a nasty bug...
* Added support to multisite installs (via a meta key)

= 0.0.1 =
* First release. Lots of code borrowed from my other SL plugin, [Online Status inSL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/online-status-insl/)
